## Installing 

### Backend
we are going to need install npm in the project
```
npm install
```
Then we are going to install the dependences used in the project using the command npm install [dependence]
```
"express" -  back end web application framework for Node.js
"cors" - node.js package for providing a Connect/Express 
"mongoose" - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment
"nodemon -D" -  tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected
```
When all the dependences are already installed, you can run the backend with the command:
```
node src/index.js
npx nodemon src/index.js
npm run dev
```
